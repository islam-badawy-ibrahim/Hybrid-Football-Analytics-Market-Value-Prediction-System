# Hybrid Football Analytics & Market Value Prediction System ⚽📊

##  Project Overview
This project is a high-performance hybrid system developed to demonstrate the integration of **Low-level programming (C++)** and **Advanced Data Science (Python)**. It is designed to analyze football player performance and predict market transfer values using Machine Learning.

##  Components

### 1. Performance Calculation Engine (C++)
- **Core Logic:** Uses a precise mathematical model to calculate "Efficiency Per 90 Minutes".
- **Technical Highlight:** Demonstrates proficiency in memory efficiency, data types, and high-speed execution.
- **Role:** Handles the raw statistical processing of player match data.

### 2. Market Intelligence Module (Python)
- **Model:** Built using **Ridge Regression** for high accuracy on specialized datasets.
- **Preprocessing:** Implements `StandardScaler` to normalize features (Age, Overall Rating, Potential).
- **Visualization:** Uses `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to provide advanced statistical trends.
- **Predictive Capability:** Includes a function to estimate the market value of any new player based on their attributes.

##  How the System is Integrated
While C++ provides the computational speed for individual metrics, Python provides the analytical depth. This combination is essential for modern **Data Science** roles where performance and scalability are key.

##  Sample Output
- **Model Accuracy:** High R² Score due to optimized Ridge parameters.
- **Visuals:** Included regression plots showing the correlation between player ratings and financial value.
